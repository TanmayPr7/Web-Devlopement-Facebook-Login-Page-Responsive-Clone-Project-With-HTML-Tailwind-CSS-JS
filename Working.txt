Basically, it's a Facebook Login Page Web Development project, created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
A few of its features include responsiveness *which is not present in actual website, hover effects, and transitions, etc.
Contains all the features of the Facebook Login landing page & many more. As a beginner, this is a fun,
exciting, and challenging to create something which we use regularly in our day to day life, as a project that I personally
enjoyed making. For this project there are no specific working principles, but as a habit,
I leave a little note in every project stating the working principle,  and so here it is.

This is the basic working principle & personal note on this Web Dev Project:)

Some Important Commands To Work With Tailwind CSS With Node JS:
1.To generate npm modules folder
=> npm run init
2.To compress project file in simgle folder
=> npm run build (Note: Before running this command make sure to add "build": {"vite build",} in the script section of package.json)
